    <h2>Welcome to a whimsical city located in Lousiana!</h2>
        <p>
        Founded in 1718 by the French, New Orleans has a rich and complex history. It was later ruled by the Spanish and briefly by the French again before being sold to the United States in the early 19th century. The city's multicultural
        heritage is evident in its architecture, cuisine, and traditions.</p>
